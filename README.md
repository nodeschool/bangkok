# NodeSchool Bangkok

Welcome to the NodeSchool Bangkok chapter's repository. We use this repository for our website and almost all our communication.

Nodeschool Bangkok is just getting started so please get in contact if you would like to help with setup or mentoring. GitHub Issues for this chapter will be used to keep track of all work that needs to be done from ideas, what needs to be done, what's being worked on and what has been resolved.

## Talk to us

We utilise [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nodeschool/bangkok/issues) like a message board and keep almost all of our communication in the open. Feel free to create new issues to make suggestions on how NodeSchool Bangkok can improve and grow.
